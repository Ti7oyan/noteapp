# Contributing to NoteApp üë®‚Äçüíª

First of all, thank you for looking at here!. NoteApp is not a very complex project, but for that reason I believe that is an opportunity to work in the smaller things that make it a cool app.

## To contribute...

1. Fork the repository, you know how this works.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Set-up the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Work on your modifications...
5. Once ready, build the app with `npm run build` and serve it `npm run serve`. This is for checking that all you made works fine.
6. Finally, push your changes and create a PR in the original repository.

You don't need to contribute directy, you can spread the word around and that will be a great action :).
